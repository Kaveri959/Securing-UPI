# Securing UPI Transactions ‚Äì A Machine Learning Approach to Fraud Detection

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By analyzing features like transaction amount, location, device info, and user behavior, the models aim to identify suspicious transactions in real-time.

## üß† Techniques Used
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), LSTM
- Data Handling: Imbalanced data handling with oversampling/undersampling
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
